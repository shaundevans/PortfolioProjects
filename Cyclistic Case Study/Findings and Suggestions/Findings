### Findings ###

(1) How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes different? 

Cyclistic members use bikes during the week, while weekends are very low volume (comparatively).   Conversely, non-members have a peak usage on Saturday and Sunday, suggesting leisure activities.  On average, non-members have a longer ride time, and tend to gravitate towards electric bike options, whereas members almost wholly exclude electric bikes from their use. 


(2) Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?

Improved access to electric bikes during peak times would likely influence casual members to become members.  This can take the form of reservation services, reduced rates, or preferential access to electric bikes rentals.   Ideally, the solution would target accessibility during peak use times (weekends). 



(3) How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

Cyclistic should target weekend electric bike accessibility and cost benefits to convert non-members into members. Targeting leisure channels (tourism/recreation) would be the most effective, since this user subset primarily uses bikes over the weekends by a significant margin.  For inter-week marketing, rate incentives would be beneficial to convert these customers into members.
