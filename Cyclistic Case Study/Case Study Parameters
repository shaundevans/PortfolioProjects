(1) Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share organization that offers bike-share options. Flexible bike-share options are part of Cyclistic's post-launch success: customers can use single-ride passes, full-day passes, or annual memberships.

    (a) How annual members and casual riders differ
    (b) Why casual riders may buy an annual membership
    (c) how digital media could affect marketing tactics
