### What This File Does 
This file provides distance between addresses in three different ways: 
  (1) Manual Entry through IDE input() requests. 
  (2) Entering data into a pandas dataframe and looping through that manually 
  (3) Using a structured list (i.e. excel/csv) for looping. 

The code pulls in the destination address and your starting point, and uses google instead of google's Map API or nominatim to obtain the distance between these two points in miles.
